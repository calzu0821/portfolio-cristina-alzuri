# portfolio-cristina-alzuri

## Description

This project is my personal portfolio page built from scratch using HTML and CSS. The main purpose of this page is to showcase my skills and talents to hiring managers, highlighting my strongest work as well as the thought process behind it. 

The motivation behind this project is to set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. By practicing my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search.

Through this project, I learned how to apply flexbox and media queries to make the page responsive and how to use CSS variables to make the code more organized and easier to maintain.
